# RAG-Powered-Document-Query-System
## Purpose: Designed a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system to enable efficient 
querying and contextual understanding of large documents, leveraging advanced NLP and AI 
models for accurate information retrieval and generation. 
## Tools & Technologies: Python, LangChain, Hugging Face Embeddings, FAISS, Groq API, 
Sentence Transformers, Jupyter Notebook, Text Processing Libraries 
## Key Contributions: 
* Implemented a document processing pipeline using LangChain for text splitting and 
embeddings. 
* Integrated Hugging Face’s sentence transformers to generate semantic embeddings 
for document chunks. 
* Built a FAISS-based vector store for fast similarity search and retrieval of relevant 
text segments. 
* Configured Groq’s language model to generate context-aware answers using retrieved 
information. 
* Developed a user-friendly interface for querying and displaying results with preserved 
text formatting. 
## Impact: Streamlined the extraction of insights from large documents, reducing 
manual search time and improving accuracy. The system supports applications in 
research, education, and content analysis by delivering precise, context-rich answers 
from unstructured text data.
